      "wage earners and clerical workers. The all urban consumer group represents over 90 percent of the total\n",
      "U.S. population. It is based on the expenditures of almost all residents of urban or metropolitan areas,\n",

      "urban wage earners and clerical workers. Not included in the CPI are the spending patterns of people\n",

      "institutions, such as prisons and mental hospitals. Consumer inflation for all urban consumers is\n",
      "measured by two indexes, namely, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the\n",
      "Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U). The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage\n",
      "Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) is based on the expenditures of households included in the CPI-U\n",
      "definition that meet two requirements: more than one-half of the household's income must come from\n",
      "clerical or wage occupations, and at least one of the household's earners must have been employed for\n",
      "at least 37 weeks during the previous 12 months. The CPI-W population represents approximately 30\n",
      "percent of the total U.S. population and is a subset of the CPI-U population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CPIs are based on prices of food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation, doctors' and dentists'\n",
      "services, drugs, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. Prices are\n",
      "collected each month in 75 urban areas across the country from about 6,000 housing units and\n",
      "approximately 22,000 retail establishments (department stores, supermarkets, hospitals, filling\n",
      "stations, and other types of stores and service establishments). All taxes directly associated with the\n",
      "purchase and use of items are included in the index. Prices of fuels and a few other items are obtained\n",
      "every month in all 75 locations. Prices of most other commodities and services are collected every\n",
      "month in the three largest geographic areas and every other month in other areas. Prices of most goods\n",
      "and services are obtained by personal visit, telephone call, web, or app collection by the Bureau's\n",
      "trained representatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In calculating the index, price changes for the various items in each location are aggregated using\n",
      "weights, which represent their importance in the spending of the appropriate population group. Local\n",
      "data are then combined to obtain a U.S. city average. For the CPI-U and CPI-W, separate indexes are\n",
      "also published by size of city, by region of the country, for cross-classifications of regions and\n",
      "population-size classes, and for 23 selected local areas. Area indexes do not measure differences in\n",
      "the level of prices among cities; they only measure the average change in prices for each area since\n",
      "the base period. For the C-CPI-U, data are issued only at the national level. The CPI-U and CPI-W are\n",
      "considered final when released, but the C-CPI-U is issued in preliminary form and subject to three\n",
      "subsequent quarterly revisions.\n",

      "Sampling Error in the CPI\n",
      "\n",
      "The CPI is a statistical estimate that is subject to sampling error because it is based upon a sample\n",
      "of retail prices and not the complete universe of all prices. BLS calculates and publishes estimates\n",
      "of the 1-month, 2-month, 6-month, and 12-month percent change standard errors annually for the CPI-U.\n",
      "These standard error estimates can be used to construct confidence intervals for hypothesis testing.\n",
      "For example, the estimated standard error of the 1-month percent change is 0.03 percent for the U.S.\n",
      "all items CPI. This means that if we repeatedly sample from the universe of all retail prices using\n",
      "the same methodology, and estimate a percentage change for each sample, then 95 percent of these\n",
      "estimates will be within 0.06 percent of the 1-month percentage change based on all retail prices. For\n",
      "example, for a 1-month change of 0.2 percent in the all items CPI-U, we are 95 percent confident that\n",
      "the actual percent change based on all retail prices would fall between 0.14 and 0.26 percent. For the\n",

      "How to Use Seasonally Adjusted and Unadjusted Data\n",
      "\n",
      "For analyzing short-term price trends in the economy, seasonally adjusted changes are usually preferred\n",
      "since they eliminate the effect of changes that normally occur at the same time and in about the same\n",
      "magnitude every year-such as price movements resulting from weather events, production cycles, model\n",
      "changeovers, holidays, and sales. This allows data users to focus on changes that are not typical for\n",
      "the time of year. \n",
      "\n",
      "The unadjusted data are of primary interest to consumers concerned about the prices they actually pay.\n",
      "Unadjusted data are also used extensively for escalation purposes. Many collective bargaining contract\n",
      "agreements and pension plans, for example, tie compensation changes to the Consumer Price Index before\n",
      "adjustment for seasonal variation. BLS advises against the use of seasonally adjusted data in\n",
      "escalation agreements because seasonally adjusted series are revised annually for five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intervention Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses intervention analysis seasonal adjustment (IASA) for some CPI\n",
      "series. Sometimes extreme values or sharp movements can distort the underlying seasonal pattern of\n",
      "price change. Intervention analysis seasonal adjustment is a process by which the distortions caused by\n",
      "such unusual events are estimated and removed from the data prior to calculation of seasonal factors.\n",
      "The resulting seasonal factors, which more accurately represent the seasonal pattern, are then applied\n",
      "to the unadjusted data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, this procedure was used for the motor fuel series to offset the effects of the 2009 return\n",
      "to normal pricing after the worldwide economic downturn in 2008. Retaining this outlier data during \n",
      "seasonal factor calculation would distort the computation of the seasonal portion of the time series\n",
      "data for motor fuel, so it was estimated and removed from the data prior to seasonal adjustment.\n",
      "Following that, seasonal factors were calculated based on this \"prior adjusted\" data. These seasonal\n",
      "factors represent a clearer picture of the seasonal pattern in the data. The last step is for motor\n",
      "fuel seasonal factors to be applied to the unadjusted data.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the seasonal factors introduced for January 2024, BLS adjusted 46 series using intervention\n",
